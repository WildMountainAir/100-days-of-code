### **Day 1: Tuesday, October 15, 2019**

**Today's Progress:** 
Today I learned about types, variables, operators and functions in JavaScript. I had an aha moment when I realized I need to initialize a function. Those parenthesis are really easy to forget.

**Thoughts:** 
I feel like this is going to be a challenge. I just am really lucky that I have friends who are willing to help me learn.

### **Day 2: Wednesday, October 16, 2019**

**Today's Progress:** 
I decided to jump into the Hack Reactor Basic Prep course to revisit some of the basics I learned yesterday. 

**Thoughts:** 
I am hoping by drilling on the fundamentals is going to be helpful for me. I am just going to keep plugging away to see how far I can get in the next 98 days.

### **Day 3: Thursday, October 17, 2019**

**Today's Progress:** 
I worked on function exercises.

**Thoughts:** 
Work has been mentally taxing and it's been difficult to remember what I learned reflecting on the previous day.

### **Day 4: Friday, October 18, 2019**

**Today's Progress:** 
I was so burned out from work today the only progress made was learning how to add, commit, and push code from VSCode to GitHub. 

**Thoughts:** 
I am so eager to get further along and start to build things!

### **Day 5: Saturday, October 19, 2019**

**Today's Progress:** 
Today I signed up for Codecademy Pro and started on the Web Development track! I worked through the HTML modules and started to touch on CSS. I really like the project based learning :D 

**Thoughts:** 
It felt good to cover the basics of HTML. I had fun building a webpage and reinforcing what I learned. As I progress I hope to update projects and reiterate on them the more I progress. Today felt great!

**Today's Progress:** 
Today I worked on my own project which was really fun. I worked through creating tables in HTML and started on forms.

### **Day 7: Monday, October 21, 2019**

**Today's Progress:** 
I didn't make progress on Codecademy today but I did work on my personal project. Next, I want to build a form so people can submit ideas or feedback. 

**Thoughts:** 
It is exciting to progress and actually see how much I have learned in a mere week!

### **Day 8: Tuesday, October 22, 2019**

**Today's Progress:** 
I was feeling real sick today but I am glad I pushed through and just hopped on Codecademy. I worked on forms today and was able to add one to my personal project!

**Thoughts:** 
It feels good to make progress on my project and within Codecademy. I wish I could code all day long and dedicate a lot more time.

###  <em>I did not make progress for 2 days. I needed to focus on my heath so I can then focus on my code. I am really greatful to have encourgaing friends through this journey. I am also excited to see how amazing the tech community is. </em>
#
### **Day 9: Friday, October 25, 2019**

**Today's Progress:** 
Working through the final HTML & CSS units on Codecademy. I finished with Form Validation.

**Thoughts:** 
I wish I wasn't at the airport trying to learn.

# 
## I needed to take time off to focus on my health. Being a good software engineer isn't just about knowing how to write code, it's also about knowing when to step back. All I have thought about is getting back into the swing of things. I am excited to begin again. 
#
### **Day 10: Tuesday, November 5, 2019**

**Today's Progress:** 
I finished up the HTML and CSS lessons in Codecademy and start on JavaScript tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** 
I got through so much content and created a handful of projects. It feels good to be coding again and progressing. I am really happy with how far I made it today.

### **Day 11: Wednesday, November 6, 2019**

**Today's Progress:** 
I worked on learning more about the GitHub Markdown language and made my log and resources page a bit fancier. Also, I learned how to finally open a view window in VS Code! Woo! And I wrapped up by completing the first JavaScript lesson on Codecademy.

**Thoughts:** 
I am pretty excited about learning JavaScript and amplifying my projects. Alson, I am absolutley loving Codecademy. I am all about the badges and gamification, it's awesome being able to see my progress. <em>Idea: Codecademy should connect to LinkedIn like DuoLingo.</em>

### **Day 12: Thursday, November 7, 2019**

**Today's Progress:** 
I learned about some of the differences between ES6 and pre-ES6 JavaScript. 

**Thoughts:** 
Today was a really long and tough day at work, the thought of coing afterwards was the only thing that got me through it. I am really glad I found something I enjoy. I read a quote last night that said, "To find your purpose, help others find theirs." I feel like that couldn't be more fitting.

I created form logic today for a quiz for work. An engineer ended up taking my project over but I plan on continuing to work on them and build it out more robust. I also started working on conditionals.

I am looking forward to spending a good chunk of time coding this weekend!
