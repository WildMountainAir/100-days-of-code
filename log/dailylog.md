# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, October 15, 2019

**Today's Progress** 
Today I learned about types, variables, operators and functions in JavaScript. I had an aha moment when I realized I need to initialize a function. Those parenthesis are really easy to forget.

**Thoughts:** 
I feel like this is going to be a challenge. I just am really lucky that I have friends who are willing to help me learn.

### Day 2: Wednesday, October 16, 2019

**Today's Progress** 
I decided to jump into the Hack Reactor Basic Prep course to revisit some of the basics I learned yesterday. 

**Thoughts:** 
I am hoping by drilling on the fundamentals is going to be helpful for me. I am just going to keep plugging away to see how far I can get in the next 98 days.

### Day 3: Thursday, October 17, 2019

**Today's Progress** 
I worked on function exercises.

**Thoughts:** 
Work has been mentally taxing and it's been difficult to remember what I learned reflecting on the previous day.
