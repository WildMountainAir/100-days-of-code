# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Tuesday, October 15, 2019

**Today's Progress** 
Today I learned about types, variables, operators and functions in JavaScript. I had an aha moment when I realized I need to initialize a function. Those parenthesis are really easy to forget.

**Thoughts:** 
I feel like this is going to be a challenge. I just am really lucky that I have friends who are willing to help me learn. 

### Day 2: Wednesday, October 16, 2019

**Today's Progress** 
I decided to jump into the Hack Reactor Basic Prep course to revisit some of the basics I learned yesterday. 

**Thoughts:** 
I am hoping by drilling on the fundamentals is going to be helpful for me. I am just going to keep plugging away to see how far I can get in the next 98 days. 

### Day 3: Thursday, October 17, 2019

**Today's Progress** 
I worked on function exercises.

**Thoughts:** 
Work has been mentally taxing and it's been difficult to remember what I learned reflecting on the previous day. 

### Day 4: Friday, October 18, 2019

**Today's Progress** 
I was so burned out from work today the only progress made was learning how to add, commit, and push code from VSCode to GitHub. 

**Thoughts:** 
I am so eager to get further along and start to build things! 

### Day 5: Saturday, October 19, 2019

**Today's Progress** 
Today I signed up for Codecademy Pro and started on the Web Development track! I worked through the HTML modules and started to touch on CSS. I really like the project based learning :D 

**Thoughts:** 
It felt good to cover the basics of HTML. I had fun building a webpage and reinforcing what I learned. As I progress I hope to update projects and reiterate on them the more I progress. Today felt great!

### Day 6: Day, October 20, 2019

**Today's Progress** 
Today I worked on my own project which was really fun. I worked through creating tables in HTML and started on forms. 

**Thoughts:** 
It was exciting to get started on my own project. I am looking forward to building something that I could potentially make money off of down the road.

### Day 7: Monday, October 21, 2019

**Today's Progress** 
I didn't make progress on Codecademy today but I did work on my personal project. Next, I want to build a form so people can submit ideas or feedback. 

**Thoughts:** 
It is exciting to progress and actually see how much I have learned in a mere week! 

### Day 8: Tuesday, October 22, 2019

**Today's Progress** 
I was feeling real sick today but I am glad I pushed through and just hopped on Codecademy. I worked on forms today and was able to add one to my personal project!

**Thoughts:** 
It feels good to make progress on my project and within Codecademy. I wish I could code all day long and dedicate a lot more time.

**Today's Progress** 
I did not make progress for 2 days. I needed to focus on my heath so I can then focus on my code.

### Day 9: Friday, October 25, 2019
